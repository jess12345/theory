# Software Architecture Foundations

## Thinking Architecturally

Conway's law:
- The structure of the software must reflect the structure of the organization developing the software
  - N-Tier software structure === N-Tier organization structure
    - UI layer === Frontend dev team
    - Backend layer === Backend dev team
    - DB Layer === Database management team
  - Micro-service software structure === Small feature team
    - Feature A (UI, Backend, DB) === Feature A team
    - Feature B (UI, Backend, DB) === Feature B team
